Quants
======

An Elm implementation of [QuAnts](https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=1293) (I found it by way of [Devine Lu Linvega's page on it](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/qu-ants.html)).

I eventually want to create something a bit more ambitious, like [MarkovJunior](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior), in Elm, and this was a ~~first~~ second step.  It's not especially pretty, but overall it's pretty decent.
