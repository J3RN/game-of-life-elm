Conway's Game of Life
=====================

I eventually want to create something a bit more ambitious, like [MarkovJunior](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior), in Elm, and this was a first step.  It's not especially pretty and the handling of the boundaries isn't quite right, but overall it's pretty decent.
